# XSStrike Brute Force Automation

This script automates the process of gathering potential XSS URLs and testing them using XSStrike.

## Usage

1. Make sure `gau`, `gf`, and `XSStrike` are installed and properly configured.
2. Customize the `encoded_payloads.txt` file to include your desired payloads for more effective testing.
3. Run the script by replacing `<domain>` with your target domain.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Step 1: Gather URLs that are potential XSS candidates
gau <domain> | gf xss | sort -u | tee Possible_xss.txt

# Step 2: Read each URL and test it with XSStrike
while IFS= read -r url; do
    echo "Testing URL: $url"
    python3 /home/kali/XSStrike/xsstrike.py -u "$url" --delay 1 -f /home/kali/encoded_payloads.txt
done < /home/kali/Possible_xss.txt



gau <domain> | gf xss | sort -u | tee Possible_xss.txt


gau <domain>: Uses the gau tool to fetch URLs for the specified domain.
gf xss: Filters the URLs using the gf tool for potential XSS vulnerabilities.
sort -u: Sorts the URLs and removes duplicates.
tee Possible_xss.txt: Saves the filtered URLs to Possible_xss.txt and prints them to the terminal.




while IFS= read -r url; do
    echo "Testing URL: $url"
    python3 /home/kali/XSStrike/xsstrike.py -u "$url" --delay 1 -f /home/kali/encoded_payloads.txt
done < /home/kali/Possible_xss.txt


        while IFS= read -r url: Reads each URL from Possible_xss.txt.
        echo "Testing URL: $url": Prints the URL being tested.
        python3 /home/kali/XSStrike/xsstrike.py -u "$url" --delay 1 -f /home/kali/encoded_payloads.txt: Runs XSStrike on the URL with a delay of 1 second between requests, using payloads from encoded_payloads.txt.

Additional Tips

    Ensure gau, gf, and XSStrike are installed and properly configured on your system.
    Customize the encoded_payloads.txt file to include your desired payloads for more effective testing.
   

This script will help you automate the process of testing multiple URLs for XSS vulnerabilities using XSStrike.
